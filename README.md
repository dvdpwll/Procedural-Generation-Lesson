# Express as an API

Express, like Rails, can be used as an API. In fact, building APIs in Express,
especially those that use MongoDB for persistence, led to the rising popularity
of Node.

Express can be used for full-stack applications (those that have server-rendered
views). However, we will use it purely as an API.

A customized template for Express is available at [ga-wdi-boston/express-template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/express-template).
It includes authentication and common middlewares so that you can start
developing an API right away.

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/node-http-server](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/node-http-server)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/mongoose-crud](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/mongoose-crud)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Develop an Express API, leveraging architectural conventions from Rails.
-   Write five CRUD endpoints for an API resource using Express, Mongoose, and
    JavaScript.
-   Prevent unauthorized users from creating or changing data through the API.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1.  Verify monogdb is runnning with `brew services list`
    (Run `brew services restart mongodb` if not)
1.  Set a SECRET_KEY in the environment.
1.  Run the API server with `npm start`. If you want your code to be reloaded on
    change, you should `npm install -g nodemon` and use `nodemon` instead of
    `npm start`.

For development and testing, set the SECRET_KEY from the root of your
 repository using:

```sh
echo SECRET_KEY=$(/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl rand -base64 66 | tr -d '\n') >>.env
```

## A Bookstore API

We've been hired to write an API for a local bookstore, 'Book Before You Leap'.
They have plans to expand in the next few years, and they'll probably rival
Amazon. Therefore, we've chosen Express because it's hip, and Mongo because it's
Web Scale™.

Let's get acquainted with how we'll use Express.

## Demo: An Example Express Controller

First, let's peek at our routes, since that's the layer that decides which code
to run for any given request. Open [`config/routes.js`](config/routes.js) and
read through it. Look familiar?

Have a look in the [`app`](app) directory. It looks a bit like Rails, too.

In [`app/controllers/examples.js`](app/controllers/examples.js), we get our
first taste of Express. What's the `(req, res, next)` signature on all our
controller actions?

The `req` object is a
[http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage)
object. The `res` object is
[http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse)
object. These are what we used in the node HTTP server. What about `next`?

> More than one callback function can handle a route (make sure you specify the
> next object).
>
> – [Express routing](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

That means **more than one action** can be run for a single request. In fact,
that's how Express keeps boilerplate to a minimum; we did something similar with
`before_filter`s in Rails. Common functionality, like error handling, can be
extracted into a middleware and run on any request you like. However, you
**must** use `next` to propagate errors onward.

Likewise, `res.json` signals to Express that we're done working on our response.
It's analogous to Rails' `render` method. If you don't use a **terminal
handler**, Express will keep the connection open waiting for one. You and
Express will both be frustrated and confused. Here's a list of terminal
handlers. You will use `res.json` and `res.sendStatus` most frequently.

| Response method      | What it means                                                                         |
|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `res.end()`          | End the response process.                                                             |
| `res.json(jsObject)` | Send a JSON response.                                                                 |
| `res.redirect()`     | Redirect a request.                                                                   |
| `res.sendStatus()`   | Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body. |

## Annotate Along: Summarize Actions in Examples Controller

Let's practice reading unfamiliar code by annotating
[`app/controllers/examples.js`](app/controllers/examples.js). As we read each
controller action, keep the following questions in mind.

-   What is the purpose of this action?
-   Does it need a singular or plural resource to build its response?
-   How is the action handling errors?
-   Why do we need to check for the existence of a record after querying?
-   Where do we get IDs from?
-   Where do we get data from when creating or updating a record?
-   Which terminal handler is used to send a response?

## Demo: An Example Express Model

Let's read [`app/models/example.js`](app/models/example.js) and answer the
following questions together:

-   What library are we using to model our resources? Does it have anything to
    do with Express?
-   What does the underscore denote in `_owner`?
-   Where should we go to find out more about an owner?
-   Why aren't we using an arrow function for the virtual attribute `length`?

## Lab: Create an Example

Start the server and try creating an example by issuing a `POST /examples`. What
happens? You might find some help in the [`scripts`](scripts) directory.

When you've created an example, try using its ID to request it via `GET
/examples/:id`. Then, create another and check your work with `GET /examples`.

## Code-Along: `POST /books`

Only authenticated users should be able to create a book.

Let's create our book model together, and one controller action. Don't forget
a route!

Make sure to save a reference to the user that created the book so we can user
it later to check ownership.

We'll need to write a test script to check our work. We'll save it as
[`scripts/books-create.sh`](scripts/books-create.sh).

We're done when we see a response similar to this one:

Expected response:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "book": {
    "__v": 0,
    "updatedAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
    "createdAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
    "_owner": "56df9716c19957cb0d836c4a",
    "title": "Invisible Monsters",
    "author": "Chuck Palahniuk",
    "price": 10.99,
    "_id": "56df974ec19957cb0d836c4d"
  }
}
```

## Code-Along: `GET /books`

Visitors to the client web application should be able to see all the books
without being logged in.

We will need to write a controller action and a test script.

Expected response:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "books": [
    {
      "_id": "56df974ec19957cb0d836c4c",
      "updatedAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
      "createdAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
      "_owner": "56df9716c19957cb0d836c4a",
      "title": "Between the World and Me",
      "author": "Ta-Nehisi Coates",
      "price": 12.99,
      "__v": 0
    },
    {
      "_id": "56df974ec19957cb0d836c4d",
      "updatedAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
      "createdAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
      "_owner": "56df9716c19957cb0d836c4a",
      "title": "Invisible Monsters",
      "author": "Chuck Palahniuk",
      "price": 10.99,
      "__v": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Lab: `GET /books/:id`

Visitors to the client web application should be able to see any book without
being logged in.

You will need to write a controller action and a test script.

Expected response:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "book": {
    "_id": "56df974ec19957cb0d836c4c",
    "updatedAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
    "createdAt": "2016-03-09T03:23:58.000Z",
    "_owner": "56df9716c19957cb0d836c4a",
    "title": "Between the World and Me",
    "author": "Ta-Nehisi Coates",
    "price": 12.99,
    "__v": 0
  }
}
```

## Lab: `PATCH /books/:id`

Only authenticated users should be able to change a book. They should not be
able to change other users' books.

You will need to write a controller action and a test script.

Expected response:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

You may wish to retrieve the book you changed to check your work.

If a different user than the owner tries to make the change, you should instead
see:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": {
    "message": "Not Found",
    "error": {
      "status": 404
    }
  }
}
```

## Lab: `DELETE /books/:id`

Only authenticated users should be able to delete a book. They should not be
able to delete other users' books.

You will need to write a controller action and a test script.

Expected response:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

If a different user than the owner tries to make the change, you should instead
see:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "error": {
    "message": "Not Found",
    "error": {
      "status": 404
    }
  }
}
```
